# Insult-Comment
In this project our goal is to decide if a comment is an insult or not. (Kaggle's Contest)

# Summary
In this project I tried to experiment with Naive Bayes's scores before and after data's 'cleaning'. Also I practised with bigrams and Laplace Smoothing. Finally one significant term of contest is that a comment can be characterizes as insult only when somebody is insulting somebody else (not something general). So for that reason I attached importance to pronouns, thinking that when somebody insults another person usually uses words like 'you','your'. So the sum of pronouns of each comment would be my new feature.

# Note 
There are some nice conclusions in the end of notebook!
